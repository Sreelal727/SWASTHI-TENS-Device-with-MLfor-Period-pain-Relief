# SWASTHI-TENS-Device-with-MLfor-Period-pain-Relief
This repository contains the code, data, and resources for the SWASTHI-TENS Device, an innovative wearable solution for period pain relief. By integrating a Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) device with Machine Learning, SWASTHI aims to provide personalized pain management for women experiencing menstrual cramps.

Features
Machine Learning for Personalization: Utilizes EMG sensor data to predict cramping intensity and pain levels, adapting the TENS pulse frequency and intensity to each user's unique pain profile.
Real-time Cramp Detection: Machine learning models identify cramping episodes based on EMG data, delivering TENS therapy as needed.
User Comfort and Aesthetics: Designed to be slim, ergonomic, and comfortable for daily wear, with a visually appealing casing tailored to fit the abdomen area.
Pain Level Prediction: Uses Random Forest and other machine learning algorithms to predict pain levels and adjust TENS settings dynamically.
Repository Contents
Code: Python code for EMG data acquisition, preprocessing, and machine learning model training.
Data: Sample datasets used for cramp detection and pain level prediction.
Hardware Integration: Code to integrate the ESP8266 microcontroller with the TENS device and EMG sensor for real-time monitoring and therapy.
Documentation: Detailed explanations of algorithms, data processing techniques, and device setup.
